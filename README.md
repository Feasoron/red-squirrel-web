What is Red Squirrel
--------------------

Red Squirre is a  angular frontend for providing management and use of food and ingredients in your home. Red Squirrel allows you to record what you have, where it is, and how much you have. Beyond that, it has built in conversions for various units, both standard (1 Gallon = 4 Cups) and food-specifc (1 cup shredded carrots = 2 carrots).
